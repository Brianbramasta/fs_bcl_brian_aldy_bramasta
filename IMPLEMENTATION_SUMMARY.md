# Fleet Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Fleet Management System based on the requirements specified in [brief.md](refference/brief.md).

## Implemented Features

### 1. User Roles

-   **Pelanggan (Customers)**: Can track shipments and book fleet vehicles
-   **Admin**: Can view fleet locations, manage fleets, and view reports
-   **Armada (Fleet personnel)**: Can check in their locations

### 2. Database Structure

Created the following database tables:

-   **fleets**: Stores fleet information (fleet_number, vehicle_type, availability, capacity)
-   **shipments**: Stores shipment information (shipment_number, shipment_date, origin_location, destination_location, status, fleet_id, customer_id)
-   **check_ins**: Stores location check-ins (fleet_id, latitude, longitude, check_in_time)
-   **users**: Extended with role field (pelanggan, admin, armada)

### 3. Core Functionality

#### 3.1 Shipment Tracking

-   Search by shipment number
-   Display shipment details and status
-   Show origin and destination locations

#### 3.2 Fleet Management

-   CRUD operations for fleet information

-   Validation for booking dates (cannot be in the past)
-   Update fleet availability after booking

#### 3.4 Location Check-in

-   Map interface for fleet personnel to check in
-   Store GPS coordinates

### 4. UI Components

-   Responsive layout with header and sidebar
-   Role-based navigation
-   Reusable components (StatusBadge, SearchBar, DataTable)
-   Mobile-friendly design

### 5. Controllers

-   **FleetController**: Manages fleet CRUD operations
-   **ShipmentController**: Handles shipment tracking and booking
-   **CheckInController**: Manages location check-ins
-   **ReportController**: Generates reports with MySQL queries

### 6. Testing

-   Feature tests for all controllers
-   Model factories for test data generation
-   Comprehensive test documentation

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Laravel 10 with PHP 8.1+
-   **Frontend**: React with Inertia.js
-   **Database**: MySQL
-   **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Build Tool**: Vite

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

    ```
4. Copy and configure the environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
5. Configure database settings in `.env`
6. Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
7. Run database seeders:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
8. Build frontend assets:
